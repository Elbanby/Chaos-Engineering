## About
Notes about Chaos Engineering. 

### Notes

Five Principles for Chaos Eng practice:

 - Build a hypothesis around steady-state behavior
 - Vary real-world events
 - Run experiments in production
 - Automate experiments to run continuously
 - Minimize blast radius

   > "Chaos Engineering may be the most approachable, efficient way to begin to navigate the complexity of your system."
 
 Methods (models) to navigate complexity 
 - Dynamic Safety Model
 - Economic Pillars of Complexity Model
 
 #### Tools
 - [Chaos Monkey](https://github.com/Netflix/chaosmonkey)
 - Chaos King
